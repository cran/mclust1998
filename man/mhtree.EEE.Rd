\title{
Classification tree for hierarchical clustering for Gaussian models with constant variance.
}
\description{
Computes a classification tree for agglomerative hierarchical clustering using
a Gaussian model in which all clusters have the same volume, shape, and 
orientation.
}
\usage{
mhtree.EEE(data, partition, min.clusters = 1)


}
\arguments{
\item{data}{
matrix of observations.
}
\item{partition}{
initial classification of the data. The default puts every observation in a
singleton cluster.
}
\item{min.clusters}{
minimum number of clusters desired. The default is to carry out agglomerative
hierarchical clustering until termination, that is, until all observations
belong to a single group. The default value is 1.
}}
\value{
an object of class \code{"mhclust"}, which consists of a classification tree with
the following attributes:

\item{call}{
a copy of the call to \code{mhclust.EEE}.
}
\item{determinant}{
value related to the determinant of the sum of sample crossproduct matrices,
which is the relevant criterion for the model, computed during the course of 
hierarchical clustering.
}
\item{dimensions}{
the data dimensions.
}
\item{initial.partition}{
the partition at which agglomerative hierarchical clustering is initiated.
}
\item{trace}{
the trace of the sum of sample crossproduct matrices produced during the
course of hierarchical clustering.
}}
\section{NOTES}{
The constant variance option is one of the slowest options for \code{mhclust},
because the model does not admit a fast hierarchical clustering algorithm.
At the same time, it is one of the more space-sefficient options.
