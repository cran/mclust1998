\title{
BIC from hierarchical clustering followed by EM for a parameterized Gaussian mixture model.
}
\description{
Bayesian Information Criterion for various numbers of clusters computed from 
hierarchical clustering followed by EM for a selected parameterization
of Gaussian mixture models possibly with Poisson noise.
}
\usage{
emclust1(data, nclus, modelid, k, equal=FALSE, noise, Vinv)


}
\arguments{
\item{data}{
matrix of observations.
}
\item{nclus}{
An integer vector specifying the numbers of clusters for which the BIC is to
be calculated. Default: 1:9 without noise; 0:9 with noise.
}
\item{modelid}{
An integer or vector of two integers specifying the model(s) to be used
in the hierarchical clustering and EM phases of the BIC
calculations. The allowed values or \code{modelid} and their
interpretation are as follows: \code{"EI"} : uniform spherical,
\code{"VI"} : spherical, \code{"EEE"} : uniform variance, \code{"VVV"} :
unconstrained  variance, \code{"EEV"} : uniform shape and volume,
\code{"VEV"} : uniform shape. 

Default: \code{c("VVV","VVV")} (unconstrained variance for both phases)
}
\item{k}{
If \code{k} is specified, the hierarchical clustering phase will use a
sample of size \code{k} of the data in the initial hierarchical
clustering phase. The default is to use the entire data set.  
}
\item{equal}{
Logical variable indicating whether or not the mixing proportions are
equal in the model. The default is to assume they are unequal.
}
\item{noise}{
A logical vector of length equal to the number of observations in the
data, whose elements indicate an initial estimate of noise (indicated by
\code{TRUE}) in the data. By default, \code{emclust1} fits Gaussian mixture
models in which it is assumed there is no noise. If \code{noise} is
specified, \code{emclust1} will fit a Gaussian mixture with a Poisson
term for noise in the EM phase. 
}
\item{Vinv}{
An estimate of the inverse hypervolume of the data region (needed only
if \code{noise} is specified). Default : determined by the function
\code{hypvol}. 
}}
\value{
Bayesian Information Criterion for the six mixture models and specified
numbers of clusters. Auxiliary information returned as attributes.
}
\section{NOTE}{
The reciprocal condition estimate returned as an attribute ranges in value
between 0 and 1. The closer this estimate is to zero, the more likely it is
that the corresponding EM result (and BIC) are contaminated by roundoff error.
